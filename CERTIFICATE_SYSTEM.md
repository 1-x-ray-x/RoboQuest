5. PDF downloads automatically with descriptive filename

### Error Handling
- **Fallback System**: If enhanced generation fails, uses pre-made template

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if certificates fail

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- **Print Optimization**: Better formatting for physical printing

### Technical Improvements

- **Batch Downloads**: Download multiple certificates at once
- **Custom Templates**: Allow users to choose certificate styles
- **Watermarking**: Add unique identifiers to prevent forgery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Certificate not downloading**: Check if achievement is actually earned
2. **PDF generation fails**: System will automatically fall back to pre-made template
3. **Name not appearing**: Verify user authentication and name data

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify certificate template files exist in public folder
- Ensure user has proper permissions and authentication

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Certificates only available to authenticated users
- Achievement completion verification required
- User-specific data isolation

### Data Privacy
- User names are embedded locally in PDFs
- No certificate data stored on server
- Downloads happen client-side for privacy
